    "[**Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN)**](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1704.01212) (Gilmer et al. 2017) is a general framework for learning on graphs that standardizes different models independently proposed by several research groups. While different works use different notations and names, we will follow the notation used in Bishop's book.\n",
    "\n",
    "The message passing algorithm that characterizes this class of models is a two steps procedure which consists, for each node, in collecting a signal from its neighbours and use it to update its hidden state. The goal is to find a new representation of the nodes in the graph, such that each node's new representation considers not only its own features but also the relevant information from its neighbours. This process allows to encode the structural and feature-based context of each node within the graph, and this richer representation can then be used for different learning tasks, at the node, edge or graph level.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration $l+1$ and for each node $n$, a message $\\boldsymbol z^{(l)}$ is computed as a function, called $\\mathrm{Aggregate}$, of the hidden state of its neighbouring nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(1) \\qquad \\qquad \\boldsymbol z^{(l)} = \\mathrm{Aggregate}(\\{\\boldsymbol h_m^{(l)}: m \\in \\mathcal N(n)\\})$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, as proposed in the original work, the inputs of $\\mathrm{Aggregate}$ can include the hidden state $\\boldsymbol h_n^{(l)}$ and the attributes of the connected edges $\\boldsymbol e_{nm}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second step, the message is used to update the hidden state of $n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(2) \\qquad \\qquad \\boldsymbol h_n^{(l+1)} = \\mathrm{Update}(\\boldsymbol h_n^{(l)}, \\boldsymbol z^{(l)})$\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of $\\mathrm{Aggregate}$ and $\\mathrm{Update}$ defines different types of layers fitting the Message Passing framework. Both functions need to be **differentiable** and can be parametrized. Additionally, $\\mathrm{Aggregate}$ should also be **permutation invariant** IE: invariant with respect to the order of neighbours.\n"

The terminology used by PyG is slightly different than what we defined. In particular, it splits the $\\mathrm{Aggregate}$ function into two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `message`, which transforms the signal from a single node $m$\n",
    "*   `aggregate`, which combines the transformed signals from the neighbours into a single message\n",

    "\n",

    "Notice what is happening: at each iteration, the nodes that are adjacent to a yellow node are being colored as we expected (the maximum value of the neighbours is 1). However, colored nodes are losing the information of their previous hidden state, and since all neighbours have a hidden state of 0 their new state is 0. Sometimes, like in this case, we need to combine the received message with the previous hidden state of the node. A common way to do this is to add a virtual edge between each node and itself, also called a \"self loop\"."

The propagation of information is linked to the concept of \"receptive field.\" This term describes the maximum distance for which a node is influenced by other nodes in the graph, a characteristic determined by the number of layers, also called depth. Through adjusting the model's depth, we can extend a node's ability to access and integrate distant information in the graph."
