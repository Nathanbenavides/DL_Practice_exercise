16244,16244,991,39,Yuck,"This looked beautiful online, but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels, with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch, and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.

a definite return. i wouldn't even recommend this at first or second cut.",1,0,4,General,Bottoms,Skirts

9735,9735,1003,52,Cute skirt for next summer,Fits well. true to size. love the kelly green color and found a blouse to match. the see-through part gives it some oomph and a little extra sexiness without being inappropriate for work. only downside is the beige color--kind of a funky bandaid-colored beige. but the blue and the green balance it out.,5,1,0,General,Bottoms,Skirts
