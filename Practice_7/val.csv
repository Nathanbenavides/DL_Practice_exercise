4415,4415,1078,41,Figure flattering and the material is so soft!,"I bought this dress in the navy stripe version and love it. the material is so soft it's like wearing pajamas, and the actual swing skirt is flattering (which surprised me when i tried it on). i wore it to work with burgundy heels and got a lot of compliments from my co-workers. i'm 5'9"", 130 lbs and the xs worked best for me.",5,1,0,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
1700,1700,860,37,Pretty and nicely cut,"The bright poppy red is gorgeous and the cut flattering and interesting. i'm usually between a m and l in tops but went with a s in this one because it looked too sloppy in my usual size. i'm a 32-34 d with arms that aren't tiny, and it's a bit tight across the shoulders when i reach forward but not enough to be a problem. in the smaller size it skims my hips nicely but isn't as long as pictured on the model. i would suggest pear-shaped girls size down if in-between. it is sheer but not so much",4,1,1,General Petite,Tops,Knits

1975,1975,862,27,Effortless style,Love the deep purple color of this cardi sweater - long and drapey looks great with leggings skinnies and jeans. my only problem is the way the loose stitching around the cuffs is makes it worrisome. wore once and already starting to get a hole. still a great piece.,4,1,0,General,Tops,Knits

2. the fabric is heavy weight, and i agree that the zipper should be longer.

3. the length is a bit long and dowdy for a pencil skirt. it's very straight. it does not taper like pencil skirts normally do.

the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit. i love the fit and make of the jumper, but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day. this is still happening after several washes, which makes me feel disappointed. it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely.",2,1,0,General Petite,Bottoms,Pants
